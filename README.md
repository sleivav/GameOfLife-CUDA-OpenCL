# Game of Life Cuda PyOpenGL

Implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in Python, PyCuda and PyOpenCL

Made for the course CC7515 - Computaci√≥n en GPU (GPU Computing), dictated by Nancy Hitschfeld at Universidad de Chile, and based on the work [here](http://www.marekfiser.com/Projects/Conways-Game-of-Life-on-GPU-using-CUDA)

## Dependencies

Everything should be on the requirements.txt file. Any newer version of PyCuda or PyOpenCL should work too.

## Testing 

Just one small test was included to ensure all three implementations are consistent.
